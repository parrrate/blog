Just some truths on why the whole AI bubble is so pathetic:

- Context being limited is key to programming. That's called abstraction.
- Difference of opinions (and, their existence at all) is critical to progress. Whereas AI is
   thoroughly incestuous.
- AI is made to deceive. There is no principal ethical difference between Captcha-solving AI and
   generative AI.

Oh, and don't forget about all the morons claiming "iT iS aN eXiStEnTiAl ThReAt!!1!!1!", especially
about so called "AGI". They're just as braindead as those who claim "AGI" is already here. But you
know what *is* actually already here? Harm from AI. Immediate harm. A *lot* of it. This is very
analogous to people who only talk about climate change being important somewhere in the future. How
about talking about how bad it already is RIGHT fucking NOW?
